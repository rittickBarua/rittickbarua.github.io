Highly experienced Consultant and applied Data Scientist with 7 years of experience in delivering enterprise-grade AI/ML solutions on Azure driving £8M+ projected savings through £10M+ project Nacross finance, healthcare and public sectors. PhD trained Engineer from University of Cambridge with a proven track record in leading cross-disciplinary teams, managing full product lifecycles, and driving digital transformation through data-driven strategies, automation, and stakeholder engagement.

My research focuses on applied machine learning that is reliable at scale. On the scientific side, I develop computer-vision pipelines for high-throughput microscopy to quantify drug-induced cellular changes and accelerate cancer research. On the enterprise side, I design and deploy GenAI systems on cloud platforms with an emphasis on safety, robustness, and cost-aware MLOps. A core thread is AI cybersecurity—mapping threat vectors across data, model, and deployment layers—and translating them into governance patterns, evaluation harnesses, and guardrails. Broadly, I’m interested in human-centred, interpretable AI that delivers measurable value in healthcare, finance, and the public sector.

1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

For those users that need more advanced functionality, the template also supports the following popular tools:
- [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) for mathematical equations
- [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) for diagraming
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/) for plotting

------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
