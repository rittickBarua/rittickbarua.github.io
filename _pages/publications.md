My research focuses on applied machine learning that is reliable at scale. On the scientific side, I develop computer-vision pipelines for high-throughput microscopy to quantify drug-induced cellular changes and accelerate cancer research. On the enterprise side, I design and deploy GenAI systems on cloud platforms with an emphasis on safety, robustness, and cost-aware MLOps. A core thread is AI cybersecurity—mapping threat vectors across data, model, and deployment layers—and translating them into governance patterns, evaluation harnesses, and guardrails. Broadly, I’m interested in human-centred, interpretable AI that delivers measurable value in healthcare, finance, and the public sector.
